Fractured Bonds|male-Jake,female-Lila,male-Sam,female-Rachel|change-Jake,Lila-apartment living room|Jake:You never listen to me.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Maybe I don't because you're always yelling.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I'm yelling because you're impossible to talk to.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:And you're perfect? You're the one who shuts me out.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I shut you out because all you do is criticize.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Criticize? I'm trying to fix things, Jake.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:By tearing me down every chance you get?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:If that's how you see it, maybe we're just wasting time.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Or maybe we're not even trying anymore.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:You think I don't try? I've been holding us together.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:By controlling every little thing? That's not holding us together.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila,Sam-office building hallway|Sam:You look like you've been through a storm.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:It's Lila. Every day is a fight.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Maybe you both need some space.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:We've tried that. It only makes things worse.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:So now you're complaining about me to Sam too?:angry|Sam:Whoa, I didn't mean to get in the middle.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:You were already in the middle, Lila. You always are.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Okay, clearly this is deeper than I thought.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Jake loves to make me the villain.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:You don't need my help for that.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-kitchen at night|Lila:Why can't you see my side for once?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Your side? It's always your way or nothing.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Because I actually care enough to fight for us.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:You call this fighting for us? It feels like war.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|mail-slow-Lila-Jake|Jake:Oh, throwing things now? Real mature.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:That was the mail you ignored for a week.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:You don't have to be so dramatic.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:You think this is dramatic? Try walking in my shoes.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Your shoes? You've never once tried to understand me.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Maybe because you make it impossible to talk to you.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila,Rachel-coffee shop corner table|Rachel:You guys seem... tense lately.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Tense is an understatement.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Don't start, Lila.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Hey, I'm just here to listen.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:He never listens, Rachel. He tunes me out.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Because it's the same argument on repeat.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Maybe you both need counseling.:thinking|Jake:Like that's going to fix everything.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:We won't know unless we try.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:What's the harm in trying, Jake?:thinking|Jake:The harm is wasting time on something broken.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:And you're so sure it's broken?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Sam-gym weightlifting area|Sam:You look like you need to hit something.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:If only that would solve things.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:What's the plan, man? Keep fighting till it breaks?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Honestly, I don't even know anymore.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Maybe it's time to stop trying to fix something that's already broken.:thinking|Jake:How do you just stop caring?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:You don't stop caring. You just start caring about yourself more.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:What if I'm not ready for that?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Then you'll stay stuck in this cycle.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Lila,Rachel-bedroom late evening|Rachel:Are you sure this is what you want?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:I don't know, Rachel. I feel like I'm losing myself.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Relationships shouldn't feel like this.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Then why is it so hard to let go?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Because you've invested so much. But sometimes, walking away is the bravest thing.:thinking|Lila:Brave doesn't feel good, though.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:No, it doesn't. But staying when it's toxic feels worse.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:How did I let it get to this point?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:By hoping it would get better. And that's not a crime.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-living room next morning|Jake:We need to talk.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Finally, something we agree on.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I don't think this is working anymore.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:You're giving up?:sad|Jake:No, I'm letting go before we destroy each other.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:So that's it?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:It has to be.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:I thought we had more fight in us.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Sometimes fighting isn't what saves things. Sometimes it's what ends them.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Rachel,Sam-park bench midday|Rachel:I heard about Jake and Lila.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Yeah, it's probably for the best.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:It's sad, though. They used to be so close.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Sometimes love isn't enough.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:But it could be, with the right effort.:thinking|Sam:Not if both sides are pulling in different directions.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Do you think they'll ever find their way back to each other?:thinking|Sam:Maybe, but only if they both change.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Lila,Rachel-art studio evening|Lila:You know, I started painting again.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:That's great, Lila! It's been years.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:It feels strange, though. Like I'm learning who I am all over again.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:That's not a bad thing. It's growth.:thinking|Lila:But I still think about Jake. What if this isn't right?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Healing isn't a straight path. Maybe it's not about right or wrong.:thinking|Lila:I guess... but it's lonely.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Lonely is better than losing yourself, Lila.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Sam-rooftop night|Sam:You've been quiet all evening.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I keep thinking about what I could've done differently.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Don't beat yourself up. Relationships take two.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:But what if I gave up too soon?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-park bench afternoon|Jake:I've been thinking about us lately.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:And what conclusion did you come to?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:That maybe we ended things too quickly.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Too quickly? Jake, we were tearing each other apart.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:But what if we could find a better way this time?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:You think we've changed enough for that?:thinking|Jake:I don't know. But I miss you.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:I miss the good moments too, but is that enough?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Rachel,Sam-cafe small table|Rachel:So, Jake reached out to Lila.:thinking|Sam:He did? That's bold.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Do you think it's a mistake?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Hard to say. People don't change overnight.:thinking|Rachel:But sometimes it takes losing someone to realize their worth.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Sure, but realization doesn't mean reconciliation.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:True, but I think they need closure, one way or another.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Closure is overrated. It's just an excuse to reopen old wounds.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-lakeside sunset|Lila:This place brings back memories.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:The good ones, I hope.:thinking|Lila:Mostly. But it's bittersweet now.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I thought this might be a good spot to talk.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:So talk, Jake. What do you want from this?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I want to know if there's still a chance.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:A chance for what? To fall back into the same patterns?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:No. A chance to build something better.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:That sounds nice, but it's not that simple.:thinking|Jake:I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:And what happens if we fail again?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Then at least we'll know we gave it everything.:thinking|change-Rachel,Lila-bookstore corner|Rachel:You're really considering getting back with him?:thinking|Lila:I don't know. He seems different, but is it enough?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:People can change, but only if they want to.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:He says he wants to try. Part of me believes him.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:And the other part?:thinking|Lila:Is scared. What if it's just more pain?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Then you'll pick yourself back up, like you always do.:thinking|Lila:It's not that simple, Rachel.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Nothing worth it ever is.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Sam-gym locker room|Sam:So, how did it go with Lila?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Better than I expected, but it's still complicated.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:It always is, man. You sure this is what you want?:thinking|Jake:I'm not sure of anything, except that I don't want to give up.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Just make sure you're not setting yourself up for heartbreak.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:I'd rather risk it than live with regret.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Well, if you need backup, you know where to find me.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Thanks, Sam. That means a lot.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Lila,Rachel-art studio evening|Lila:Rachel, I've made my decision.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:And? Are you going back to him?:thinking|Lila:I'm going to give it one more chance.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Just be careful, okay? Protect your heart.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:I will. But I can't keep wondering ‘what if.':has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:I get it. Just promise me you'll put yourself first this time.:thinking|Lila:I promise.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-quiet restaurant dinner|Jake:I wasn't sure you'd come.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Neither was I.:thinking|Jake:I want to start fresh, Lila. No more blaming, no more fighting.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:That sounds nice, but can we actually do it?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:We won't know unless we try.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:I'm willing to try, Jake. But this is our last chance.:thinking|Jake:I understand. And I won't waste it.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Rachel,Sam-cafe outdoor patio|Rachel:So, they're giving it another shot.:thinking|Sam:Guess they're braver than I thought.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:Love makes people do crazy things.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Or stupid things. Time will tell.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:You're such a pessimist, Sam.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:I'm a realist. There's a difference.:thinking|Rachel:Well, I hope they prove you wrong.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Me too.

It felt... normal.:thinking|Jake:Normal is a good start, right?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Yeah, it is.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:So, can I see you again?:thinking|Lila:One step at a time, Jake.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:Fair enough. Goodnight, Lila.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Goodnight, Jake.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Rachel,Sam-park trail morning|Rachel:I think they might actually make it.:thinking|Sam:We'll see. It's still early.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Rachel:You're really rooting for them, aren't you?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Maybe. Even I want to be wrong sometimes.:thinking|Rachel:That's growth, Sam. I'm proud of you.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Sam:Don't get used to it.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|change-Jake,Lila-park bench afternoon|Jake:I've been thinking about us lately.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:And what conclusion did you come to?:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Jake:That maybe we ended things too quickly.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:Too quickly?

But this time, we set boundaries.:thinking|Jake:Agreed. No more crossing lines.:has_emotion_but_no_emoji_popup|Lila:We'll see, Jake.
